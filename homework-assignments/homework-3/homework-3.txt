1. Flexbox and CSS grids are both layout systems. Flexbox is one-dimensional, either a row or a column. CSS grids are two-dimensional, so you can work with rows and columns at the same time in a grid system.

It is imperative these days because of how much of the web is on phones. It is implemented in CSS through media queries and viewport. Bootstrap is a common framework for responsive design.
